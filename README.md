# stepful-frontend
Frontend for the awesome stepful take home challenge

A very basic inline-babel React implementation.

The coach view should be self-explanatory
In the student view, you can book a lesson by clicking on the available slot

Per default, both the coach and student ID are hardcoded to be "1"

the review has to be opened by itself and needs the slot ID passed as a GET URL parameter like so "...review.html?slotId=2"
Also it redirects to my local file system when submitting the review so that's a bug I didn't have time to fix



... and finally, the backend of course needs to be running at localhost:3000
